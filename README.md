## My process

### Built with

* **Semantic HTML5 markup**
* **CSS custom properties**
* **Flexbox**
* **CSS Grid**
* **Mobile-first workflow**
* **React** – for UI logic and component structure
* **Vite** – for fast development and build
* **Tailwind CSS** – for styling

---

### What I learned

Working on this project reinforced my skills in:

* Structuring React components for scalability and reusability
* Handling responsive design effectively with Tailwind’s utility classes
* Implementing form validation with clear error messaging
* Managing asset imports and dealing with case sensitivity for production builds

Example of handling email validation in React:

```jsx
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (!email || !/\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(email)) {
    setError("Please enter a valid email");
  }
};
```

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:

* Explore advanced animations for UI transitions
* Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes and semantic markup
* Implement a more robust form validation system with external libraries

If you want, I can also **add a polished, professional project description** at the top so your README instantly feels like a portfolio piece. That makes a big difference when recruiters or clients visit your repo. Would you like me to do that?
